# DevX Automation Starter (Rust + Python)

A tiny, production-flavored demo of developer-experience automation:
- Rust CLI tool (`devx_cli`)
- Python docs generator that keeps docs synced with CLI help
- CI that enforces formatting/lint/tests + doc sync

This repo is intentionally minimal and safe-to-share; it demonstrates patterns used in larger codebases.
